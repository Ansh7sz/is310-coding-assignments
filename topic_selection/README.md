- **Proposed Dataset:** Valorant Leaderboard Statistics (Kaggle)
- **Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliibrahim10/valorant-stats
- **File Used:** val_stats.csv

- **Description:**  
This dataset contains leaderboard statistics for over 80,000 Valorant players collected from a public stats tracker (e.g., tracker.gg), focusing on ranked/competitive play. Each row represents a player with multiple performance metrics such as ranking position, rating, and in‑game stats that reflect their performance on the leaderboard. The val_stats.csv file provides a structured table that can be used to analyze relationships between different stats and a player’s standing on the leaderboard

- **Relation to Group Theme:**  
The dataset directly fits a theme of competitive gaming and esports performance, since it captures how players perform in ranked Valorant, a major tactical shooter. Leaderboards are a core cultural feature of competitive games, so these statistics connect to questions about skill, status, and improvement in online gaming communities. Because the data is large‑scale and standardized, it lets the group explore performance patterns within one specific game while still relating to broader ideas about player behavior and competitive culture.

- **Why This Topic:**  
As a competitive valorant player i feel like it is a popular, data‑rich esport, and this dataset offers enough observations and features to support meaningful quantitative analysis over the semester. It aligns with personal interest in Valorant while also enabling generalizable questions about what distinguishes top players from the rest of the ladder.
